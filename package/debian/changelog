  * More cross-platform services: rpcbind smartd ypbind nisdomain
  * system-control reset is now for start/stop what system-control preset is for enable/disable.
  * convert-systemd-units now handles some directives that can be repeated.
  * Added foreground, background, and userenv commands.
  * system-control now performs a DOWN-wait-KILL procedure on services that take more than 60 seconds to stop.

nosh (1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * The mount and fsck services are now generated from templates.
  * Template instance names can now optionally be escaped.
  * The TCP and UDP socket listeners now support SO_REUSEPORT and IP_FREEBIND/IP_BINDANY.
  * Added make-private-fs, set-mount-object, and unshare.
  * Tweaked the service manager's state machine to better handle some state transitions.
  * More cross-platform services: motd
  * convert-systemd-units now handles IP addresses in ListenStream=/ListenDatagram=.
  * The disallocate option to open-controlling-tty has been removed.  It was a Linuxism that never worked, and that relies upon hardwired assumptions about device names even on multi-head systems.
  * open-controlling-tty now works around a Linux bug with the TIOCSCTTY ioctl where it sometimes returns an error but works anyway.
  * start/stop/enable/disable/preset/status/show now understand the .service, .socket, and .target extensions to imply different search paths.
  * The system manager now attempts to properly shut down the service manager and its logger at system shutdown.
  * The service manager now stops+unloads services and exits when it is sent a termination signal.
  * There is now a bundled Guide.
