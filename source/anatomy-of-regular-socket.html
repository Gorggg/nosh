Anatomy of a typical TCP service
</h1>

<p>
The http6d service in the regular services collection is an example of a typical and commonly used TCP service.
Its <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>restart</code> programs are fairly trivial and straightforward.
The meat of the service is its <code>run</code> and <code>service</code> programs.
</p>

<p>
The service could be arranged as a single <code>run</code> program.
However, that does not permit adjustment of the service program, including its command-line arguments, whilst the service is up.
Having a separate <code>service</code> program, that is chained to for each new TCP connection, permits an administrator to adjust the main service program without taking the service down.
Of course, this has to be done carefully, because a live service could run the <code>service</code> program at any time, including halfway through when a text editor is updating the script.
So always edit a "service.new" script and then, after setting execute permission, atomically rename it to <code>service</code>.
</p>

<p>
The <code>run</code> and <code>service</code> programs are as follows:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/nosh
#Run file generated from build/http6d.socket
tcp-socket-listen --systemd-compatibility --backlog 2 0 80
softlimit -o 20 -d 50000
envuidgid publicfile
tcp-socket-accept --connection-limit 16 --no-delay 
ucspi-socket-rules-check
./service</blockquote></pre>

<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/nosh
#Service file generated from build/http6d@.service
#HTTP service over IP4/IP6 using Bernstein's publicfile
httpd /home/publicfile/public</blockquote></pre>

<p>
Like many of the pre-packaged services, these scripts are in fact automatically generated from a description file that is in the source package.
(In fact, that description is a slight variant on a systemd unit file.)
Both invoke <a href="nosh.html"><code>nosh</code></a> as their script interpreter, and comprise a series of utility commands, each chain-loading to the next, passing along what program arguments it has not itself absorbed.
</p>

<p>
In the <code>run</code> program:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="nosh.html"><code>nosh</code></a> chain loads tcp-socket-listen.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="tcp-socket-listen.html"><code>tcp-socket-listen</code></a> opens a TCP socket, binds it to a wildcard IP address and the well-known TCP port for HTTP, and then chain loads softlimit.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="softlimit.html"><code>softlimit</code></a> adjusts some kernel resource limits for the current process, and chain loads envuidgid.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="envuidgid.html"><code>envuidgid</code></a> reads the system's account database for the user "publicfile", sets up some environment variables for later use, and chain loads tcp-socket-accept.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="tcp-socket-accept.html"><code>tcp-socket-accept</code></a> sits waiting for TCP connections on the listening socket that was opened for it, forking a new process for each accepted connection and chain loading to ucspi-socket-rules-check in that process.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="ucspi-socket-rules-check.html"><code>ucspi-socket-rules-check</code></a> checks a local database, in the service directory, for access controls on the connecting client IP address, and if the client is permitted access chains to the <code>service</code> program.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
In the <code>service</code> program:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>nosh chain loads the service program proper, which is 
<a href="http://cr.yp.to/publicfile.html">Bernstein's publicfile</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>publicfile picks up the environment variables earlier set by envuidgid, changes to the data root directory, drops superuser privileges, and serves HTTP requests over the TCP connection.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The amount of setup in the <code>run</code> and <code>service</code> scripts depends from what the service program itself does, of course.
If publicfile did not change working directory and root directory, for example, one could do so with the chain-loading <code>chdir</code> and <code>chroot</code> commands.
</p>

<p>
Because the service's <code>run</code> program was generated from a systemd unit file, the <code>run</code> program passes tcp-socket-listen the <code>--systemd-compatibility</code> option.  
This isn't strictly necessary here, since the program that accepts the socket connections doesn't require 
<a href="http://freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_listen_fds.html">systemd's LISTEN_FDS protocol</a>
for knowing which open file descriptor is the listening TCP socket.
Were it a systemd-specific program, however, it would need this; and the option does no harm to non-systemd-specific server programs.
</p>

<p>
Looking at the rest of the service bundle, one finds the standard things for a "server" service.
The service is auto-started (when enabled) by the "server" system target.
It is stopped by the "shutdown" system target.
It requires for correct operation that all services in the "basic" system target be started, before it itself is started.
Its output is sent to a logger service.
