<h2>
Creating bundles
</h2>

<p>
If you are unlucky enough to have a package that does not supply service bundle directories for its services, you have some options.
</p>

<h3>
You can build a bundle using parts from some public <code>run</code> script collections.
</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://smarden.org/runit/runscripts.html">Gerrit Pape made a collection of some run scripts some years ago.</a>
<a href="http://thedjbway.b0llix.net/services.html">Wayne Marshall has collected a few more.</a>
Simply take an appropriate <code>run</code> script, add minimal <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>restart</code> programs, put the lot into a <code>service</code> directory, put that into a bundle directory, and enable/start the service.
</p>

<p>
Minimal <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>restart</code> scripts are simply:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/nosh
true</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Note that Gerrit Pape's and Wayne Marshall's collections use shells as the script interpreters.
Several of the scripts can be simplified <em>yet further</em> with use of <code>nosh</code> and its built-in toolset.
Somme of them also rely upon tools such as <code>chpst</code> and <code>tcpsvd</code>, which one of course replaces with the equivalent daemontools-alike tool(s) and some combination of <a href="tcp-socket-listen.html"><code>tcp-socket-listen</code></a>, <a href="tcp-socket-accept.html"><code>tcp-socket-accept</code></a>, and <a href="ucspi-socket-rules-check.html"><code>ucspi-socket-rules-check</code></a>.
</p>

<h3>
You can import a systemd <em>service unit</em> file.
</h3>

<p>
<a href="converting-systemd-units.html">
If the package comes with a systemd service unit file (and potentially an accompanying socket unit file), you can import it.</a>
Simply run <code>system-control convert-systemd-units <i>servicename</i></code> and the import utility will attempt to import the service and write a bundle directory.
(You can control where the bundle directory is written.)
This can cope with many systemd service units, as long as they aren't Linux-specific, esoteric, or too clever by half.
</p>

<p>
The import utility will display warnings about anything that it didn't understand or ignored.
</p>

<h3>
You can simply write a bundle.
</h3>

<p>
As mentioned above, minimal <code>start</code>, <code>stop</code>, and <code>restart</code> scripts are very simple.
So, too, are <code>run</code> scripts.
</p>

<p>
The service interdependencies and orderings are usually quite simple, too:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>mkdir -p wants after before stopped-by wanted-by
ln -s /etc/system-manager/targets/basic after/
ln -s /etc/system-manager/targets/basic wants/
ln -s /etc/system-manager/targets/shutdown before/
ln -s /etc/system-manager/targets/shutdown stopped-by/
ln -s /etc/system-manager/targets/workstation wanted-by/</pre></blockquote>

<p>
Tailor this according to need, of course.
The service may be wanted by the "server" or "multi-user" targets rather than by the "workstation" target, for example.
