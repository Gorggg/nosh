<h1>
Handling old log mechanisms
</h1>

<p>
The daemontools way of logging for many years has been to just write to standard error.
After a decade and a half of pressure, quite a few services can be set up to work this way nowadays.
Many services can thus have their logging handled independently of that of other services, by a dedicated "log" service running behind a security partition, removing the problems of centralized logging such as vulnerability to flooding attacks, a single I/O bottleneck, and mixture of trusted and untrusted content.
But there remain some diehards that cannot be configured this way.  
</p>

<h2>
Component commands
</h2>

<p>
The <a href="klog-read.html"><code>klog-read</code></a> and <a href="syslog-read.html"><code>syslog-read</code></a> commands form the bases of services that can handle old log mechanisms.
<code>klog-read</code> is a simple UCSPI program that expects its standard input to be stream-based.
<code>syslog-read</code> is a simple UCSPI program that expects its standard input to be datagram-based.
</p>

<p>
They are intended to be more secure than the old-style <code>rsyslog</code> or Wettstein <code>syslog</code> programs.
They don't need superuser permissions at any point, don't parse client-supplied content (trusted or otherwise), and don't require ownership of or read/write access to any files or directories.
Should either be compromised, which is hard(er) given the elimination of parsing, the attacker doesn't gain superuser privileges, or any ownership of or access to any (non-world-accessible) filesystem object.
</p>

<p>
They are also simpler, by design.
They leave off some of the bells and whistles of those programs, which are less necessary with this toolset or approached an entirely different way.
Logs are <em>already</em> distributed into multiple sets, by the very nature of dedicated "log" services; logs are already autorotated; logs are already <em>strictly</em> size-capped.
All of these are the domain of a "log" service that is security-partitioned from the services running <code>klog-read</code> or <code>syslog-read</code>.

<h2>
Kernel logging
</h2>

<p>
Plumbed together with <a href="fifo-listen.html"><code>fifo-listen</code></a>, <code>klog-read</code> forms the <code>klog</code> service.
This service listens to the operating system kernel's log device (<code>/proc/kmsg</code> on Linux, <code>/dev/klog</code> on the BSDs) and writes out all that it receives.
It feeds an ordinary log service, so kernel logs end up in a normal, automatically rotated, strictly size capped, set of log files like any other.
</p>

<h2>
"syslog" logging
</h2>

<p>
Plumbed together with <a href="local-datagram-socket-listen.html"><code>local-datagram-socket-listen</code></a>, <code>syslog-read</code> forms the <code>local-syslog-read</code> service.
This service listens to the GNU C library's log socket (<code>/dev/log</code> on Linux, <code class='filename'>/run/log</code> on the BSDs) and writes out all that it receives.
</p>

<p>
Plumbed together with <a href="local-datagram-socket-listen.html"><code>local-datagram-socket-listen</code></a>, <code>syslog-read</code> forms the <code>systemd-syslog-read</code> service.
This service listens to the systemd-journal's log socket (<code>/run/systemd/journal/syslog</code>) and writes out all that it receives.
</p>

<p>
Plumbed together with <a href="udp-socket-listen.html"><code>udp-socket-listen</code></a>, <code>syslog-read</code> forms the <code>udp-syslog-read</code> service.
This service listens to the conventional "syslog" UDP port and writes out all that it receives.
</p>

<p>
They all feed ordinary log services, so local and remote logs end up in a normal, automatically rotated, strictly size capped, set of log files like any other.
The services are entirely independent, though.
It is not possible for a remote client to flood the local logs, or vice versa.
It is not possible for remote log data to masquerade as local data.
