<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>
<command>open-controlling-tty</command> is a chain-loading utility that opens a terminal as a
controlling terminal, sets its own standard I/O file descriptors to it, and then
chain loads to <replaceable>next-prog</replaceable> with the <citerefentry><refentrytitle>execvp</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry> function.  
</para>

<para>
<replaceable>next-prog</replaceable> may contain its own command line options, which <command>open-controlling-tty</command> will ignore.
</para>

<para>
<command>open-controlling-tty</command> expects to inherit the terminal
character device filename to open as the value of the <code>TTY</code>
environment variable, which it expects to have been set up by a program such as
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>vc-get-tty</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
or
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pty-get-tty</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.  
This can be either a virtual or a real terminal.
It opens this terminal, hangs up (or otherwise disassociates) any existing
processes for which it was still a controlling terminal or which had open file
handles to it; assigns it as its own controlling terminal; sets its own
standard input, standard output, and standard error file descriptors to it
(closing whatever they were previously open to); and then (if everything
succeeds) chain loads <replaceable>next-prog</replaceable>.
</para>

<para>
<command>open-controlling-tty</command> does not call
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>setsid</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>
to become a session leader.
On some operating systems it it necessary to already be a session leader in 
order to set a controlling terminal.
On those operating systems, it is thus necessary to chain to
<command>open-controlling-tty</command> from
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>setsid</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>.
</para>

<para>
<command>open-controlling-tty</command> does not make any attempt to adjust its
process group or the foreground process group of the controlling terminal.
Dealing with these is the province of a job-control shell, which may not even
run as this process.
(Linux
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>login</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
with PAM runs the job-controlling shell as a child process, for example.)
</para>

<para>
If the <arg>--exclusive</arg> command line option is used, it will
attempt to use the <code>TIOCEXCL</code>
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>ioctl</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>
function to put the terminal device into "exclusive" mode.
</para>

<refsection><title>Linux</title>

<para>
Unless the <arg>--no-vhangup</arg> command line option is used, which
disables calling the
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>vhangup</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>
system call, <command>open-controlling-tty</command> has to open the terminal
device file twice, once so that it can disconnect/hangup existing processes,
which of course disconnects itself at the same time, and once again to gain the
controlling TTY afterwards.
There is a race condition here, where the character device file could be
unlinked or otherwise altered in between the two opens.
</para>

</refsection><refsection><title>BSD</title>

<para>
<command>open-controlling-tty</command> opens the terminal device file once,
because BSD has no
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>vhangup</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>
system call.
Instead, on BSD
<command>open-controlling-tty</command> calls
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>revoke</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>
before opening the terminal device file, unless the <arg>--no-revoke</arg>
command line option is used.
A similar race condition exists, except that it is between the call to
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>revoke</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>
and the call to then
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>open</refentrytitle><manvolnum>2</manvolnum></citerefentry>
the terminal device file.
Again, the character device file could be unlinked or otherwise altered in between the two.
</para>

</refsection>

<para>
To restrict the processes able to take advantage of these races to just those
programs running as the current user or the superuser, system administrators
should ensure that the directory containing the character device file is not
writable by untrusted accounts; and programs that invoke
<command>open-controlling-tty</command> should ensure that the character device
file is owned by the effective UID of the process, and has <code>rw-</code>
permissions for that owner alone, no other user or group having any
permissions.
The
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>grantpt</refentrytitle><manvolnum>3</manvolnum></citerefentry>
library function does the latter.
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>pty-get-tty</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
calls this function, and
<citerefentry><refentrytitle>vc-get-tty</refentrytitle><manvolnum>1</manvolnum></citerefentry>
performs the moral equivalent for virtual consoles.
