<code>/etc/rc.conf</code> conversion
</h1>

<p>
The native mechanism for this system is the service bundle.
Services are enabled/disabled with service bundle mechanisms, and service environment variables are set with the likes of <a href="envdir.html"><code>envdir</code></a> processing a directory within the service bundle.
There are two ways in which settings from <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> and <code>/etc/rc.conf.local</code> are imported.
</p>

<h2>
Service preset information
</h2>

<p>
One function of <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> and <code>/etc/rc.conf.local</code> on BSD systems is to enable and disable services.
This is done by setting configuration variables, whose names are the name of the service plus a standard suffix, to "YES" or "NO".
</p>

<p>
The <a href="system-control.html"><code>system-control&nbsp;preset</code></a> command automatically imports these settings when determining whether a service should be enabled or disabled.
</p>

<p>
It only affects the enabled/disable state.
A disabled service that does not automatically start at bootstrap can still be manually started later.
The NetBSD <code>rc</code> system has no notion of being able to manually start disabled services, in contrast, as the NetBSD <code>rc</code> mechanism at bootstrap always attempts to start every service.
The enable flag actually behaves as an inverted inhibitor, simply blocking all attempts to start the service, bootstrap or otherwise, rather than as a positive selector to select which services to automatically start.
</p>

<h2>
Daemon environment information
</h2>

<p>
Another function of <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> and <code>/etc/rc.conf.local</code> on BSD systems is to hold daemon environment variable information.
Conventionally, environment variables begin with the name of the service.
</p>

<p>
If you always manipulate daemon environment variable information with the BSD <code>rcctl</code> command, rather than by editing <code>/etc/rc.conf</code> and <code>/etc/rc.conf.local</code> directly, then environment variable information will be edited directly within service bundles.
The toolset comes with a replacement <a href="rcctl.html"><code>rcctl</code></a> command that translates <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> subcommands into the service bundle equivalent, editing files in the service bundle's <code>env/</code> subdirectory with <a href="system-control.html"><code>system-control&nbsp;set-service-env</code></a>, <a href="system-control.html"><code>system-control&nbsp;unset-service-env</code></a>, and <a href="system-control.html"><code>system-control&nbsp;print-service-env</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
As the manual page mentions, best practice <em>even with the original OpenBSD tool</em> is to <em>not</em> get into the bad habit of using <code>rcctl&nbsp;set&nbsp;</code><i>name</i><code>&nbsp;status</code> instead of <code>rcctl&nbsp;enable&nbsp;</code><i>name</i> and <code>rcctl&nbsp;disable&nbsp;</code><i>name</i>.
The <code>set</code>/<code>get</code> way of doing things not only doesn't work with the <a href="rcctl.html"><code>rcctl</code></a> shim but doesn't even work for NetBSD, DragonFly BSD, FreeBSD, or PC-BSD, none of which are compatible with OpenBSD's unique <code>rc.conf</code> variable naming scheme.
In contrast, the <code>enable</code>/<code>disable</code> way of doing things works both with the original tool and the shim.
(Ports of the original OpenBSD tool to other BSDs will also likely ensure that <code>enable</code>/<code>disable</code> do the right thing for the target platform.)
