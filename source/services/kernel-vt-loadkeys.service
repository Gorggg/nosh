Description=Set up kernel virtual terminals keyboard map
# The point of this service is to set up the kernel VTs really early, so that one can interact with fsck.
# Unfortunately, the keys and font utilities on Linux require that /usr/share already be checked and mounted.
# And on the gripping hand, fsck is run non-interactively anyway.
