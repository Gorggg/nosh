<h2>
Compatible old-style startup
</h2>

<p>
As an alternative to the full startup and shutdown mechanisms that involve running the system manager, one can use a mechanism that operates more like traditional daemontools.
The service manager still runs, but instead of being sent control messages by <a href="system-control.html"><code>system-control</code></a> it is sent control messages by <a href="service-dt-scanner.html"><code>service-dt-scanner</code></a>, which implements old-style daemontools service activation involving a <code>/service/</code> directory.
</p>

<p>
Of course, one has to do one's own system management, with some program running as process #1 that invokes <a href="service-manager.html"><code>service-manager</code></a> and <code>service-dt-scanner</code>.
Exactly what one uses is beyond the scope of this guide, obviously.

<h3>
Old-style startup under systemd
</h3>

<p>
The package comes supplied with some unit files that enable one to run the service manager and old-style scanner under systemd.
</p>

<ul>
<li><p>
<code>service-manager.socket</code> is a systemd <em>socket unit</em> that defines a local-domain datagram socket named <code>/run/service-manager/control</code>.
<code>service-manager.service</code> is a systemd <em>service unit</em> that defines the <em>socket-activated</em> service associated with that socket.
The service runs <code>service-manager</code>, which understands the
<a href="http://freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_listen_fds.html">systemd LISTEN_FDS convention</a> 
and so can be run as a systemd socket-activated service in this manner.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<code>service-manager-svscan.path</code> is a systemd <em>path unit</em> that tells systemd to watch the <code>/service/</code> directory.
<code>service-manager-svscan.service</code> is a systemd <em>service unit</em> that defines the <em>path-activated</em> service that is associated with that path.
The service runs <code>service-dt-scanner</code>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
You must enable the path and the socket units if you wish to run the service manager under systemd.
What happens at system bootstrap, with these enabled, is:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
systemd, monitoring the <code>/service/</code> directory as a result of activating the path unit, sees that the directory is non-empty.
</p></li>
<li><p>
systemd activates the <code>service-manager-svscan.service</code> service, running <code>service-dt-scanner /service/</code>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<code>service-dt-scanner</code> scans <code>/service/</code> and for every service found it sends a LOAD command to the <code>/run/service-manager/control</code> socket.
</p></li>
<li><p>
systemd, monitoring the <code>/run/service-manager/control</code> socket as a result of activating the socket unit, sees that requests have arrived on the socket.
</p></li>
<li><p>
systemd activates the <code>service-manager.service</code> service, running <code>service-manager</code> with an open file descriptor for the control socket.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<code>service-manager</code> loads and manages the services that <code>service-dt-scanner</code> tells it to.
</p></li>
</ol>
