Troubleshooting
</h1>

<h2>
A service is continually switching between the "running" and "failed" states, and shows an uptime of 0 seconds (or 1 second).
</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com./jonathan.deboynepollard/FGA/daemontools-service-not-staying-up.html">
This service is failing to start properly; investigate its log and check its run script.</a>
</p>

<h2>
A service is stuck in the "starting", "failed", or "stopping" states.
</h2>

<p>
The <a href="service-control.html"><code>service-control</code> command</a> causes the service manager to send signals to the service process(es).
Those processes include the ones that run in the "starting", "failed", and "stopping" states &mdash; namely the <code>start</code>, <code>restart</code>, and <code>stop</code> programs and anything that they in their turn run.
So just terminate the process(es) with <code>service-control --terminate</code>.
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind that some "sysinit" services do things in their <code>start</code> programs that may take a long time.
The "fsck@" service <code>fsck</code>s a volume in its "starting" state, for example.
These long-running initialization actions are <em>not</em> necessarily stuck just because they take a long time.
</p>

<h2>
The system bootstrap never starts the "normal" target.
</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>
You have your <code>/usr</code> and <code>/var</code> filesystems on separate volumes and you haven't run <code>system-control enable mount@-usr mount@-var</code>.
These mount services are not enabled as shipped.
You have to enable them if you have separate <code>/usr</code> and <code>/var</code> volumes.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Service A specifies that it is to be started after service B (or service B has specified that it is to start before service A), one or both services are directly or indirectly wanted by the "normal" target, and service B has failed to start.
</p></li>
<li><p>
You have an enabled service whose <code>supervise</code> directory is on a read-only filesystem.
Notice that "sysinit" services locate their <code>supervise</code> directories under <code>/run/service-bundles/early-supervise/</code> for this reason.
</p></li>
</ul>
