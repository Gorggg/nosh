<refsection><title>Description</title>

<para>
<command>vc-ncurses-io</command> is the I/O back-end for a (user-space) virtual
console, that realizes the virtual console on a(nother) terminal.
It uses wide-character ncurses (sometimes a.k.a. ncursesw) to do so, and thus
expects that terminal to be already connected to its standard input and
standard output.
</para>

<para>
It opens the character/attribute buffer file <replaceable>filename</replaceable> and
the input FIFO <replaceable>fifoname</replaceable>.
These are the "master side" interfaces of the virtual console.
It is the user's responsibility to ensure that these refer to the same,
single, virtual console.
</para>

<para>
If then enters a loop where it simultaneously:
</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para>
writes all data received from its standard input to the input FIFO, using
ncurses to retrive the input; and
</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para>
writes the contents of the character/attribute buffer file to its standard
output, using ncursesw to write the output.
</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>
It only requires sufficient privileges to access the file and the FIFO.
Superuser privileges are not necessary.
The recommended configuration is that the file and the FIFO are (respectively)
readable and writable by a dedicated unprivileged user or group.
