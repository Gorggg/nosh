<h1>
Virtual terminal login
</h1>

<p>
This package contains tools for running and managing TUI login services on both kernel and user-space virtual terminals.
It also contains pre-written service bundles for such TUI login services.
</p>

<h2>
Example service bundle <code>run</code> scripts
</h2>

<p>
The <code>run</code> scripts are interpreted by <a href="nosh.html"><code>nosh</code></a> and are created from a template with the terminal name hardwired.

<p>
A <code>run</code> script to provide TUI login on kernel virtual terminal <code>/dev/ttyv4</code> would be something like this:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/nosh
setsid
vc-get-tty ttyv4
open-controlling-tty
vc-reset-tty
login-banner /etc/issue
login</pre></blockquote>

<p>
A <code>run</code> script for a service to provide TUI login on user-space virtual terminal <code>/run/dev/vc1</code> would be something like:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>#!/bin/nosh
setsid
vc-get-tty vc1/tty
open-controlling-tty
vc-reset-tty
login-banner /etc/issue
login</pre></blockquote>

<h2>
Script composition and the toolset
</h2>

<p>
The <code>run</code> scripts for these services use the chain loading tools to do what one would otherwise do with <code>fgetty</code> or <code>mingetty</code>.
They are even more minimal than "minimal <code>getty</code>" is, and cut out much of the functionality of a full <code>getty</code> that is either invariant or non-existent on virtual terminals.
</p>

<p>
Several parts of this are specialized, hardwiring things that are variable in general, but that are in fact invariant for virtual terminals.
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Serial-line getty programs like <code>mgetty</code> and <code>agetty</code> deal in things like modem connect strings, serial line speeds, modem flow control, parity, dial-out interlocks, and suchlike.
None of those things apply to virtual terminals; and the tools are simpler for having no dealings with them.
</p></li>
<li><p>
As their names suggest, <a href="vc-get-tty.html"><code>vc-get-tty</code></a> and <a href="vc-reset-tty.html"><code>vc-reset-tty</code></a> are specialized tools for virtual terminals; the former only knows about the terminal types for virtual terminals, and the latter only knows about the control sequences for resetting virtual terminals.
Both the terminal types and their control sequences are fixed by the user-space terminal emulator or the terminal emulator in the operating system kernel, and won't change in the way that real terminals attached to serial lines can.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
The chain <code>login-banner /etc/issue login</code> is a common sequence for login services.
<code>run</code> scripts are recomposable and this chain is an example of that.
One can adjust the behaviour of the service to suit particular needs by altering the tool chain or particular tool options.
For examples:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
Some <code>login</code> programs employ an idle timeout feature, whereby they exit if login has not completed within a set period of time, such as 60 seconds.
Terminal login as a proper service, managed by a service manager, operates suboptimally if the service is continually exiting, because <code>login</code> has timed out, every 60 seconds.
At the very least, it is annoying chaff in the service logs.
One way to fix this is to remove the timeout from <code>login</code>'s configuration file, whatever that may be, of course.
Another is to put <a href="login-prompt.html"><code>login-prompt</code></a> into the chain:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>login-prompt login-banner /etc/issue login</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Having <code>login-prompt</code> run first ensures that the service does not keep timing out and exiting.
The prompt that it displays is of course familiar Unix behaviour, that mimics the behaviour of serial line <code>getty</code> services on variable-speed lines.
They can require that one press Return several times as the program attempts to guess the correct terminal line speed to set.
</p></li>
<li><p>
<code>login</code> programs handle the creation, and often nowadays the cleanup, of <code>utmpx</code> database entries for successful logins.
On modern BSDs the notion of <code>utmpx</code> records for anything other than the logged-in state of a terminal has been abolished.
Linux still retains the old notion of terminals that are in the "init", "getty", and "login" states, even though they no longer apply.
(The "init" state has no meaning for systems where the terminal login service isn't managed by process #1 any more; and as can be seen here there is no real "getty" state for kernel virtual terminals as most of the serial line functions of <code>getty</code> don't apply.)
To maintain such additional records one simply inserts <a href="login-process.html"><code>login-process</code></a> into the chain:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>login-prompt login-banner /etc/issue login-process login</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>
On Linux and BSDs, kernel virtual terminals may retain terminal state from previous logins that affects the viewability of subsequent logins.
Existing processes can also end up retaining open file descriptors for the terminal device.
To forcibly reset a virtual console, using mechanisms that are specific to kernel virtual consoles, one can employ the <code>--hard-reset</code>, <code>--text-mode</code> and other options to <code>vc-reset-tty</code>; and to forcibly remove access to open file descriptors one can employ the <code>--vhangup</code> or <code>--revoke</code> options to <a href="open-controlling-tty.html"><code>open-controlling-tty</code></a>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<p>
There are some differences between user-space and kernel virtual terminals that simplify such scripts yet further:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>
User-space virtual terminals are created afresh (a new pseudo-terminal master and slave pair) at service start, so there is no need for the <code>--revoke</code> or <code>--vhangup</code> option to <code>open-controlling-tty</code>,
</p></li>
<li><p>
User-space virtual terminals are initialized into a sane state (both the line discipline and the terminal emulator's attributes, colours, and character repertoire) at start, so there is no need for the <code>--hard-reset</code> option to <code>vc-reset-tty</code>,
</p></li>
<li><p>
User-space virtual terminals do not have a graphics mode, so there is no need for the <code>--text-mode</code> option to <code>vc-reset-tty</code>.
</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>
BSD tools for <code>ttylogin</code> service management via <code>/etc/ttys</code>
</h2>

<p>
<code>ttylogin</code> services can of course be managed just like ordinary services, enabling them so that they auto-start at bootup and starting and stopping them with normal service control commands.
However, one might decide to retain the BSD <code>/etc/ttys</code> mechanism as the master settings list for all terminals.
This is done with a preset conversion command, which one invokes whenever changes are made to <code>/etc/ttys</code> (just as one has to run conversion commands to take human format data and place it in the actual machine-readable database files when one has made changes to things like <code>/etc/passwd</code> and <code>/etc/termcap</code>).
</p>

<p>
The <a href="convert-ttys-presets.html"><code>convert-ttys-presets</code></a> command can convert the on/off information for individual virtual terminals that is stored in <code>/etc/ttys</code> into enable/disable presets for the matching <code>ttylogin</code> services.
In order to pick up changes to <code>/etc/ttys</code> when they are made one:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
&hellip; runs <code>system-control&nbsp;convert-ttys-presets&nbsp;--prefix&nbsp;ttylogin@&nbsp;ttyv{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}</code> to convert the records in <code>/etc/ttys</code> into preset information for the <code>ttylogin@ttyv{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.service</code> services; and
</p></li>
<li><p>
&hellip; runs <code>system-control&nbsp;preset&nbsp;ttylogin@ttyv{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.service</code> to enable or disable the service according to the preset information.
(One can also run <code>system-control&nbsp;reset&nbsp;ttylogin@ttyv{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.service</code> to immediately start or stop the service according to the preset information.)
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that this allows one to list both kernel and user-space virtual terminals in <code>/etc/ttys</code>, alongside one another.
</p>
